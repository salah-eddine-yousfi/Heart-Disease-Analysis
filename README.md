# 🫀 Heart Disease Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a concise exploratory analysis of heart disease data to identify
key risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease.  
It follows a structured data analysis pipeline from raw data to actionable insights.

## 🧭 Project Steps

### 1️ Data Loading
- Loaded a heart disease dataset containing demographic and clinical features.
- Inspected data structure and target variable.

---

### 2️ Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing and duplicate values.
- Verified data types and corrected inconsistencies.

---

### 3️ Feature Engineering
- Selected relevant clinical features related to heart disease.
- Encoded categorical variables for analysis.
- Prepared numerical features to ensure consistency and interpretability.
- Created analysis-ready features for correlation and visualization.

---

### 4️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed feature distributions and summary statistics.
- Compared patients with and without heart disease.
- Studied relationships between key variables and disease presence.

---

### 5️ Visualization & Correlation Analysis
- Generated visualizations (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps).
- Identified important correlations between features and heart disease outcome.

---
### 6 Modeling
- Built a machine learning classification model to predict heart disease presence.
- Trained the model using engineered features.
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.

---

### 7 Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimized model hyperparameters to improve predictive performance.
- Applied systematic tuning techniques (e.g. grid search).
- Selected the best-performing model configuration.
